NOTE: We observed an issue with copying queries from
online jq playground to VS Code and back. Queries worked
fine in playground but stopped working if copied back from
VS Code. We haven't discovered what causes this issue.
It might be necessary to rewrite queries in playground manually
to avoid the errors or use CL tool instead.
